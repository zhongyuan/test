#Overview#

When a GAIA application wants to display webpages and interact with them, it needs to use WebView API. GAIA WebView API is based on WebKit rendering engine GAIA port.

WebView class is the major entrance for WebView API. It is a UI component that displays webpages. As a basic component for GAIA Browser, WebView can also be integrated into an application. It can either display a remote/local webpage or load static HTML data. 

WebSettings helps WebView app for managing settings state for a WebView.

GAIA WebView applications also need to handle WebView API callbacks by implementing WebViewClient and WebChromeClient.

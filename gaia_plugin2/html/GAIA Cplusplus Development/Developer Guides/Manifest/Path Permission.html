<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Defines the path and required permissions for a specific subset of data within a content provider. This element can be specified multiple times to supply multiple paths.</p>
<h2>Attributes:</h2>
<p><strong><em>gaia:path</em></strong><br>
A complete URI path for a subset of content provider data. Permission can be granted only to the particular data identified by this path. When used to provide search suggestion content, it must be appended with "/search_suggest_query".</p>
<p><strong><em>gaia:pathPrefix</em></strong><br>
The initial part of a URI path for a subset of content provider data. Permission can be granted to all data subsets with paths that share this initial part.</p>
<p><strong><em>gaia:pathPattern</em></strong><br>
A complete URI path for a subset of content provider data, but one that can use the following wildcards:</p>
<ul>
<li>An asterisk ('*'). This matches a sequence of 0 to many occurrences of the immediately preceding character.</li>
<li>A period followed by an asterisk (".*"). This matches any sequence of 0 or more characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because '\' is used as an escape character when the string is read from XML (before it is parsed as a pattern), you will need to double-escape. For example, a literal '*' would be written as "\*" and a literal '\' would be written as "\\". This is basically the same as what you would need to write if constructing the string in Java code.</p>
<p>For more information on these types of patterns, see the descriptions of PATTERN_LITERAL, PATTERN_PREFIX, and PATTERN_SIMPLE_GLOB in the PatternMatcher class.</p>
<p><strong><em>gaia:permission</em></strong><br>
The name of a permission that clients must have in order to read or write the content provider's data. This attribute is a convenient way of setting a single permission for both reading and writing. However, the readPermission and writePermission attributes take precedence over this one.</p>
<p><strong><em>gaia:readPermission</em></strong><br>
A permission that clients must have in order to query the content provider.</p>
<p><strong><em>gaia:writePermission</em></strong><br>
A permission that clients must have in order to make changes to the data controlled by the content provider.</p>

##Description:##

Requests a permission that the application must be granted in order for it to operate correctly. Permissions are granted by the user when the application is installed, not while it's running.

For more information on permissions, see the Permissions section in the introduction and the separate Security and Permissions document. A list of permissions defined by the base platform can be found at android.Manifest.permission.

##Attributes:##

***gaia:name***<br>
The name of the permission. It can be a permission defined by the application with the [Permission](Manifest/Permission.html) element, a permission defined by another application, or one of the standard system permissions, such as "android.permission.CAMERA" or "android.permission.READ_CONTACTS". As these examples show, a permission name typically includes the package name as a prefix.

##Description:##

Indicates what hardware and software features the application requires. For example, an application might specify that it requires a physical keyboard or a particular navigation device, like a trackball. The specification is used to avoid installing the application on devices where it will not work.

If an application can work with different device configurations, it should include separate <uses-configuration> declarations for each one. Each declaration must be complete. For example, if an application requires a five-way navigation control, a touch screen that can be operated with a finger, and either a standard QWERTY keyboard or a numeric 12-key keypad like those found on most phones, it would specify these requirements with two <uses-configuration> elements as follows:

        <uses-configuration gaia:reqFiveWayNav="true" gaia:reqTouchScreen="finger"
                            gaia:reqKeyboardType="qwerty" />
        <uses-configuration gaia:reqFiveWayNav="true" gaia:reqTouchScreen="finger"
                            gaia:reqKeyboardType="twelvekey" />

##Attributes:##

***gaia:reqFiveWayNav***<br>
Whether or not the application requires a five-way navigation control - "true" if it does, and "false" if not. A five-way control is one that can move the selection up, down, right, or left, and also provides a way of invoking the current selection. It could be a D-pad (directional pad), trackball, or other device.

If an application requires a directional control, but not a control of a particular type, it can set this attribute to "true" and ignore the reqNavigation attribute. However, if it requires a particular type of directional control, it can ignore this attribute and set reqNavigation instead.

***gaia:reqHardKeyboard***<br>
Whether or not the application requires a hardware keyboard - "true" if it does, and "false" if not.

***gaia:reqKeyboardType***<br>
The type of keyboard the application requires, if any at all. This attribute does not distinguish between hardware and software keyboards. If a hardware keyboard of a certain type is required, specify the type here and also set the reqHardKeyboard attribute to "true".

The value must be one of the following strings:

<table border="1" width="1000">
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>undefined</td>
  <td>The application does not require a keyboard. (A keyboard requirement is not defined.) This is the default value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>nokeys</td>
  <td>The application does not require a keyboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>qwerty</td>
  <td>The application requires a standard QWERTY keyboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>twelvekey</td>
  <td>The application requires a twelve-key keypad, like those on most phones - with keys for the digits from 0 through 9 plus star (*) and pound (#) keys.</td>
</tr>
</table>
	
***gaia:reqNavigation***<br>
The navigation device required by the application, if any. The value must be one of the following strings:

<table border="1" width="1000">
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>undefined</td>
  <td>The application does not require any type of navigation control. (The navigation requirement is not defined.) This is the default value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>nonav</td>
  <td>The application does not require a navigation control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>dpad</td>
  <td>The application requires a D-pad (directional pad) for navigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>trackball</td>
  <td>The application requires a trackball for navigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>wheel</td>
  <td>The application requires a navigation wheel.</td>
</tr>
</table>

If an application requires a navigational control, but the exact type of control doesn't matter, it can set the reqFiveWayNav attribute to "true" rather than set this one.

***gaia:reqTouchScreen***<br>
The type of touch screen the application requires, if any at all. The value must be one of the following strings:

<table border="1" width="1000">
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>undefined</td>
  <td>The application doesn't require a touch screen. (The touch screen requirement is undefined.) This is the default value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>notouch</td>
  <td>The application doesn't require a touch screen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>stylus</td>
  <td>The application requires a touch screen that's operated with a stylus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>finger</td>
  <td>The application requires a touch screen that can be operated with a finger.</td>
</tr>
</table>

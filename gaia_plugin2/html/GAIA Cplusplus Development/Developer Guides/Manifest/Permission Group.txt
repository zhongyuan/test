##Description:##

Declares a name for a logical grouping of related permissions. Individual permission join the group through the permissionGroup attribute of the <permission> element. Members of a group are presented together in the user interface.

Note that this element does not declare a permission itself, only a category in which permissions can be placed. See the <permission> element for element for information on declaring permissions and assigning them to groups.

##Attributes:##

***gaia:description***<br>
User-readable text that describes the group. The text should be longer and more explanatory than the label. This attribute must be set as a reference to a string resource. Unlike the label attribute, it cannot be a raw string.

***gaia:icon***<br>
An icon representing the permission. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image definition.

***gaia:label***<br>
A user-readable name for the group. As a convenience, the label can be directly set as a raw string while you're developing the application. However, when the application is ready to be published, it should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized like other strings in the user interface.

***gaia:name***<br>
The name of the group. This is the name that can be assigned to a [Permission](Manifest/Permission.html) element's <permissionGroup> attribute.

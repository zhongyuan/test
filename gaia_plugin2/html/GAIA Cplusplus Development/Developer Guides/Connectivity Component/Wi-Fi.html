<h1>Wi-Fi</h1>
<p>Wi-Fi allows your application to connect to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and to transfer data over the network.</p>
<p>The gaia::connectivity namespace enables your application to activate and deactivate a local Wi-Fi device, and to connect to a WLAN network in the infrastructure mode. The Wi-Fi features include:</p>
<pre><code>Wi-Fi device management with the gaia::connectivity::WifiManager class
Wi-Fi connection management with the WifiManager class for the infrastructure mode
</code></pre>
<h2>Infrastructure Mode</h2>
<p>Infrastructure mode is used to connect to a wireless local area network (WLAN). Infrastructure mode requires a wireless access point. To connect to a WLAN, a client must be configured to use the same service set identifier (SSID) as the access point.</p>

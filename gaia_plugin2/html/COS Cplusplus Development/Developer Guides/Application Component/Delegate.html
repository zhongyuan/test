<h1>Delegate</h1>
<p>The Delegate is for creating an extenal thread, in a process differs from a
 Page process, to process the long-term task.</p>
<p>There are two methods almost all subclasses of Delegate will implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>onInvoke is where you want your delegate to excercise
   the authority. Here you will not be asked to return as soon as possible
   , but to do any task until time is up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>onTimedout is where you deal with the time-out. Most
   importantly, any changes made by the user should at this point be
   committed (usually to the {android.content.ContentProvider}
   holding the data).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><p>The COS system will allow the delegate doing its work at proper time.
 Any task, within the time slice, will not be asked to give up its ownership of
 thread. Once the time is up, the hook onTimedout will be called to notice.</p>
<p><p>The COS system will attempt to keep the process hosting a delegate
 around as long as the delegate invoked or has principal alive.
 When running low on memory and needing to kill existing processes, the
 priority of a process hosting the delegate will be the higher of the
 following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the delegate is currently executing code in its
 onLoad(), onInvoke(), or onTimedout() methods, then the hosting process will
 be a foreground process to ensure this code can execute without being killed.</li>
<li><p>If the delegate has been started, then its hosting process is considered
 to be less important than any processes that are currently visible to the
 user on-screen, but more important than any process not visible.  Because
 only a few processes are generally visible to the user, this means that
 the delegate should not be killed except in extreme low memory conditions.</li>
<li><p>The delegate's hosting process is never less important than the page which
 dispatches the delegate at meanwhile. That is, if its principal is visible to
 the user, then the delegate itself is considered to be visible.</li>
<li><p>An invoked delegate can use the renewPeriod or reignPeriod
 API to put the delegate in a foreground state, where the system considers
 it to be something the user is actively aware of and thus not a candidate
 for killing when low on memory.  (It is still theoretically possible for
 the delegate to be dismissed under extreme memory or performance pressure from the
 current foreground application, but in practice this should not be a concern.)</li>
</ul>
<p><p>Note this means that most of the time your delegate is running, it may
 be killed by the system if it is under heavy memory or performance pressure.
 If this happens, the system will later try to redispatch the delegate. An important
 consequence of this is that if you implement onInvoke()
 to schedule work to be done asynchronously or in another thread, then you
 may want to implement onTimedout() to finish the asynchronous
 tasks, so that it does not get lost if your delegate is killed while processing it.</p>
<p><p>Consider that there will not be any other application components running in the
 same process as the delegate. It means, of course, there will not be any UI thread or
 response-sensitive issues of the process itself.</p>
<p><p>You can use cidl for bindDelegate. For example, in sdk/example/core/DelegateTest.
 You can use below command.
 cidl -I./ ITestRemoteDelegate.cidl</p>

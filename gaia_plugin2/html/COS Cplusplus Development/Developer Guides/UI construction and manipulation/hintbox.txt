# Hint Box #

## Description #
*HintBox* is a message indicator. 
It shows a quick message on the surface of screen and does not interrupt users manipulation. 
*HintBox* disappears automatically after a short duration and does not accept any interaction event. 
If the application needs users responses for further actions, consider using *Status Bar Notification* instead.

## Text HintBox #
*makeTextN()* is an easy way to show a text message on the screen. 
Developers need not to prepare any widget but just a text string that they want to inform users. 
*makeTextN()* is going to create a *HintBox* instance and return its pointer as well. 
**Developers need to delete the instance** if it is not useful anymore. 
There are three parameters required for *makeTextN()*, the page pointer, the text message and the displaying duration. 
For example,

    gaia::ui::HintBox* phBox = gaia::ui::HintBox::makeTextN(pPage, "Hello", HintBox::LENGTH_SHORT);
    phBox->show();

If you want to reuse the HintBox, just call *setText()* to change the text message and call *show()* to bring it out again. 

    phBox->setText("New Message");
    phBox->show();

Otherwise, delete it to release the memory. 

    delete phBox;

## Custom HintBox #
*HintBox* also allows developers to create their own customized message box. 
Developers might prepare a preferable widget and call *setWidget()* to mount it at *HintBox*. 
If developers wants to place the *HintBox* at a specific location, call *setGravity()* or *setLocation()* to define the *HintBox* location. *setLocation()* is based on the top-left of the screen.
Also, the showing duration is configurable by calling *setDuration()*.

    phBox = new HintBox(pPage);
    phBox->setWidget(pTextWidget);
    phBox->setDuration(HintBox::LENGTH_LONG);
    phBox->setLocation(150, 450); //150 and 450 pixels relative to left and top boundaries respectively. 
    phBox->show();

## Note #
* Header: gaia/ui/HintBox.h
* You might not see the *HintBox* on the screen if you delete it too early, please delete it at appropriate time.
* Do not use *HintBox* constructor to create HintBox instance without calling *setWidget()*. If so, call 
*HintBox::makeTextN()* instead.

#Data Storage#

SDK provides several options for you to save persistent application data. 
The solution you choose depends on your specific needs, such as whether the data should be private to
your application or accessible to other applications (and the user) and how much space your data requires.
<p>
Your data storage options are the following:
</p>
##ApplicationPreferences##
Store private primitive data in key-value pairs.

##Internal Storage##
Store private data on the device memory.

##External Storage##
Store public data on the shared external storage.

##SQLite Databases##
Store structured data in a private database.

#Overview#

When a COS application wants to display webpages and interact with them, it needs to use WebView API. COS WebView API is based on WebKit rendering engine COS port.

WebView class is the major entrance for WebView API. It is a UI component that displays webpages. As a basic component for COS Browser, WebView can also be integrated into an application. It can either display a remote/local webpage or load static HTML data. 

WebSettings helps WebView app for managing settings state for a WebView.

COS WebView applications also need to handle WebView API callbacks by implementing WebViewClient and WebChromeClient.

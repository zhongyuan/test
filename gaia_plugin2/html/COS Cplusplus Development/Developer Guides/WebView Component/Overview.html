<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>When a COS application wants to display webpages and interact with them, it needs to use WebView API. COS WebView API is based on WebKit rendering engine COS port.</p>
<p>WebView class is the major entrance for WebView API. It is a UI component that displays webpages. As a basic component for COS Browser, WebView can also be integrated into an application. It can either display a remote/local webpage or load static HTML data. </p>
<p>WebSettings helps WebView app for managing settings state for a WebView.</p>
<p>COS WebView applications also need to handle WebView API callbacks by implementing WebViewClient and WebChromeClient.</p>

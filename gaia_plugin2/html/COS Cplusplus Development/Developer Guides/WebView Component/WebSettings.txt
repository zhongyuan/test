# WebSettings

Manages settings state for a WebView. When a WebView is first created, it obtains a set of default settings. These default settings will be 
returned from any getter call. A WebSettings object obtained from WebView->getSettings() is tied to the life of the WebView. 

WebSettings can get and set some features of WebView, and let WebView show different forms. Such as UserAgent, font size, cache path, zoom and so on.

Here's a example,  enable the javascript:

<pre class="prettyprint">
 
  websettings->setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
  
</pre>

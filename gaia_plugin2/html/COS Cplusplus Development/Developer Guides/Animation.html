<h1>Animation</h1>
<p>The Cos framework provides two animation systems: property animation and widget animation. Both animation systems are viable options, but the property animation system, in general, is the preferred method to use, because it is more flexible and offers more features. In addition to these two systems, you can utilize Drawable animation, which allows you to load drawable resources and display them one frame after another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The property animation system lets you animate properties of any object, including ones that are not rendered to the screen. The system is extensible and lets you animate properties of custom types as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Widget Animation can only be used for Widgets. It is relatively easy to setup and offers enough capabilities to meet many application's needs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drawer animation involves displaying Drawer resources one after another, like a roll of film. This method of animation is useful if you want to animate things that are easier to represent with Drawable resources, such as a progression of bitmaps</p>

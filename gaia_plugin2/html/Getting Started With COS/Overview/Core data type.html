<h1>Core Data Type</h1>
<h2>Primitive Data Type</h2>
<p>Gaia has redefined types to keep system protability.
Please include <strong>sys/types.h</strong> while using these types.</p>
<p>In order to maintain protability, programmers should avoid using low-level memory operations.
For example, bitwise left shift might cause unexpected results when porting to different machines.</p>

<h2>Collection</h2>
<p>In SDK, Gaia provides 5 basic colloections, including Array, Vector, List, HashMap and HashSet.
These collections have different properties, which should be noticed while using.
Detailed illustrations are mentioned as follows.</p>
<h3>1. Array</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single shared buffer: One of copied instances modifies the content of array, the content of other instances will also be modified.<br />
</p>
<pre><code>Array&lt;int32_t&gt; array(10);  
for (int32_t i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {  
    array[i] = i;  
}  
Array&lt;int32_t&gt; array2(array);   // Using copy constructor  
array2[5] = 100;  
if (array[5] == array[5]) {     // Should be equal  
    // Do something...  
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Vector</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.<br />
</p>
<pre><code>Vector&lt;int32_t&gt; vec;  
for (int32_t i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {  
    vec.append(i);  
}  
Vector&lt;int32_t&gt; vec2(vec);      // Still only one instance  
vec2.insertAt(0, 1);            // Tying to modify content, copy right now!!
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. List</h3>
<ul>
<li>Non-copy-on-write: Create copied instance right away.</li>
<li>Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. HashMap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.</li>
<li>Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. HashSet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.</li>
<li>Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rule of thumb:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Array has special copy mechanism which maintains only one instance. If that answers your needs, give it a try.</li>
<li>Vector is usually efficient on data access with copy-on-write and ordered data arrangement. If no other requests, vector is a recommanded choice. (random access visit)</li>
<li>If datum is frequently inserted/removed, then list is the right choice. (traversal visit)</li>
<li>If you demand fast data searching and don't care about how data is ordered, choose HashMap and HashSet.</li>
</ul>

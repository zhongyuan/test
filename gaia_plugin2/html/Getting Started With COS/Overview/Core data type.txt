# Core Data Type 

## Primitive Data Type

Gaia has redefined types to keep system protability.
Please include **sys/types.h** while using these types.

In order to maintain protability, programmers should avoid using low-level memory operations.
For example, bitwise left shift might cause unexpected results when porting to different machines.

## Collection

In SDK, Gaia provides 5 basic colloections, including Array, Vector, List, HashMap and HashSet.
These collections have different properties, which should be noticed while using.
Detailed illustrations are mentioned as follows.

### 1. Array
* Single shared buffer: One of copied instances modifies the content of array, the content of other instances will also be modified.  

        Array<int32_t> array(10);  
        for (int32_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  
            array[i] = i;  
        }  
        Array<int32_t> array2(array);   // Using copy constructor  
        array2[5] = 100;  
        if (array[5] == array[5]) {     // Should be equal  
            // Do something...  
        }

* Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.

### 2. Vector
* Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.  

        Vector<int32_t> vec;  
        for (int32_t i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  
            vec.append(i);  
        }  
        Vector<int32_t> vec2(vec);      // Still only one instance  
        vec2.insertAt(0, 1);            // Tying to modify content, copy right now!!

* Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.

### 3. List
* Non-copy-on-write: Create copied instance right away.
* Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.

### 4. HashMap
* Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.
* Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.

### 5. HashSet
* Copy-on-write: Copy when one of callers trying to modify.
* Non-thread safe: User should protect array access by himself/herself while reading/writing data concurrently in different thread.

###Rule of thumb:
* Array has special copy mechanism which maintains only one instance. If that answers your needs, give it a try.
* Vector is usually efficient on data access with copy-on-write and ordered data arrangement. If no other requests, vector is a recommanded choice. (random access visit)
* If datum is frequently inserted/removed, then list is the right choice. (traversal visit)
* If you demand fast data searching and don't care about how data is ordered, choose HashMap and HashSet.

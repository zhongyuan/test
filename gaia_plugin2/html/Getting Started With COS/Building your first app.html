<h1>Building your first app</h1>
<p>There are two ways to creat gaia app. The one is to use GDT(Gaia developement tools, an Eclipse plugin provide for create gaia app), and the other is build scripts provided in COS SDK. Here, we'll introduce the build scripts in SDK and how to use it to build our gaia app from scratch. For how to GDT create gaia app, please refer to (GDT in Eclipse).</p>
<p>The main aim of these scripts is to help develope COS app easily and make build progress smoothly. It composes of several mk files, and each file have its own resposibility. The build scripts only generate APK package instead of executable binary program.
We'll take HelloWorld as example to show how use SDK.</p>

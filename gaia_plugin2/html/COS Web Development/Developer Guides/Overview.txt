#Overview#

COS supports standalone web applications with its builtin Web Runtime. You can develop applications using common web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then install and run them on COS devices.

The power of web applications is based on the openness of web technologies. By embracing open web technologies, you can benefit from hundreds of open source web frameworks and libraries; you can choose from different kinds of development tools; at the same time, cross-platoform becomes possible, you can easily port web applications to other platforms.

COS Web Runtime functions like a container for web applications. It aims to maximize the value of open web technologies for applications. Here are some feature highlights:

- State-of-art HTML5 / CSS3 support. Allow you to create fancy UIs and much more.
- Great JavaScript performance.
- Supports a variety of standard web APIs. So you can do many things traditionally only available for native applications, such as using device's accelerometer sensor.
- Support packaged application. Run applications offline.
- Applications run in separate processes. Better security.

All of these enable you create web applications with native-like user experiences.

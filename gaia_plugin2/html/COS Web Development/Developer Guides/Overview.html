<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>COS supports standalone web applications with its builtin Web Runtime. You can develop applications using common web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then install and run them on COS devices.</p>
<p>The power of web applications is based on the openness of web technologies. By embracing open web technologies, you can benefit from hundreds of open source web frameworks and libraries; you can choose from different kinds of development tools; at the same time, cross-platoform becomes possible, you can easily port web applications to other platforms.</p>
<p>COS Web Runtime functions like a container for web applications. It aims to maximize the value of open web technologies for applications. Here are some feature highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>State-of-art HTML5 / CSS3 support. Allow you to create fancy UIs and much more.</li>

</ul>
<p>All of these enable you create web applications with native-like user experiences.</p>

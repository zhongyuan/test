# $(PROJECT_ROOT)/Gaia.mk #

$(PROJECT_ROOT)/Gaia.mk is mainly used to generate pkg file. You can set the final pkg file name, which lib will be added, which certificate will be used, and so on ...

**LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME**

Used to save final pkg's file name. LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME := HelloWorld means it HelloWorld.pkg will come out.

**LOCAL_GAIA_SHARED_LIBRARIES**

Used to indicate which so that will be added in the final pkg file. Once you list more than one so in the variable, all these so are all added in pkg. LOCAL_GAIA_SHARED_LIBRARIES := libHelloWorld means the final pkg will contain libHelloWorld.so in lib sub folder. Usually, LOCAL_GAIA_SHARED_LIBRARIES's value is equal to the value of LOCAL_MODULE in $(PROJECT_ROOT)/src/Gaia.mk.

**LOCAL_CERTIFICATE**

Used to save the certificate file name which is used to sign pkg. All the available certificate is located in $(SDK_ROOT)/build/security. LOCAL_CERTIFICATE := platform means pkg is signed by platform.x509.pem and platform.pk8.

**LOCAL_GAIA_PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARIES**

Used to add third party prebuilt so in pkg. Once you list more than one so in the variable, all these so are all added in pkg. LOCAL_GAIA_PREBUILT_SHARED_LIBRARIES := $(PROJECT_ROOT)/lib/libAMapGAIA.so means libAMapGAIA.so under lib folder will be put into pkg. Note: Full path is need for the lib. 

# $(PROJECT_ROOT)/src/Gaia.mk #


$(PROJECT_ROOT)/src/Gaia.mk is mainly used to generate so file, which will be packed into pkg. Variables in this file are used to control how to generate so.


**LOCAL_MODULE**

Used to save the name of so file. LOCAL_MODULE := libHelloWorld means the final lib named libHelloworld.so, which will be packed into pkg file.

**LOCAL_GAIA_R_PACKAGES**

Used to access user/system defined resource. LOCAL_GAIA_R_PACKAGES := HelloWorld means you use resource defined by youself, please set its value the same as the LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME. To use system resource, please use LOCAL_GAIA_R_PACKAGES := HelloWorld gaia-framework-res.

**LOCAL_SRC_FILES**

Used to save all the c/cpp source file, all the file use relative path compare to $(LOCAL_PATH).

**LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES**

It used to store all the dependency lib that current module needs, all these libs are under $(SDK_ROOT)/lib. You just list the file name in LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES.

**LOCAL_C_INCLUDES**

Used to store the head file search path, need absolute path. LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(PROJECT_ROOT)/include means add include into head search path while compiling.


**LOCAL_CPPFLAGS**

Used to add build flag for CPP compiling. LOCAL_CPPFLAGS := DTEST means define macro TEST for CPP file.

**LOCAL_CFLAGS**
Used to add build flag for both C & CPP compiling. LOCAL_CPPFLAGS := DTEST means define macro TEST for both C/CPP file.

**LOCAL_LDFLAGS**
Used to add link flag for lib while linking. LOCAL_LDFLAGS := $(PROJECT_ROOT)/lib/libXXX.so means linking against libXXX.so under lib folder. Full path needed.

**LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES**
Used to store the needed static lib while building module. LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := $(PROJECT_ROOT)/lib/libXXX.a means adding libXXX.a while linking.

**LOCAL_GROUP_STATIC_LIBRARIES**
Used to group all static lib when linking. LOCAL_GROUP_STATIC_LIBRARIES := true means group all static lib while linking.

<p>The GAIA architecture consists of the following layers.</p>
<h2>Linux Kernel</h2>
<p>This layer contains either the real-time operating system or the Linux kernel, which provides security, memory management, process management, network, driver model and so on.</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p>This layer contains a collection of C/C++ libraries called by the GAIA system components. eg libc, media, graphics, sqlite, etc.</p>
<h2>Framework</h2>
<p>This layer is the core of the GAIA system. It provides the Acitivity manager, window manager, view system, content provider, package manager, telephony manager etc.</p>
<h2>SDK and Runtime</h2>
<p>This layer contains GAIA native SDK, Web runtime and java runtime, for which we can develop GAIA native app, web app or android app.</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>Based on the SDK and Runtime layer, we can develop GAIA native app, web app and android app.</p>
